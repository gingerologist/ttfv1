# AD9834

## SPI

SPI is configured in CubeMX with the following settings:

- SPI2
- Transmit Only Master
- Hardware NSS Disable
- 8bit Motorola MSB FIrst
- Clock at 1Mbps
- CPOL = 1, CPHA = 1 (Mode 3)

A detailed example is given in

https://www.analog.com/en/resources/app-notes/an-1070.html

Notice in code and document, there is a difference in endianness.

In code, the first two bytes are:

```c
data[0] = 0x21;
data[1] = 0x00;
```

In document, the first 16bit word is `0x2100`.

The TestAD9834 is probably coded with help from Claude. No idea
why

- SPI is not configured in 16bit mode.
- Hardware NSS is not used.

## Code

The official example is straight foward.

## TODO

- [ ] Test the old function.
